// There's probably a more efficient way of getting this problem done without
// using a sieve, but I wanted to take the approach and apply a comical ammount
// of optimisations. With that in mind, I joined the following approaches:
//
//  1. Look-up table: the first 8 primes are precomputed;
//  2. Only lookup numbers which are congruent with 1 or 5 mod 6. The others are
//     either divisible by 2 or 3 or both;
//  3. Memoise all the primes that are found along the way. This adds a space
//     complexity of O(n) and a maximum memory use of just over 16GB, but allows
//     us to have much shorter iterations, because we do not uselessly use complex
//     numbers for primality checks. This allows us to somewhat compensate the fact
//     that the spacing between primes tends to become bigger, although there is
//     still a candidate for every 2 in 6 numbers until n primes are found.
